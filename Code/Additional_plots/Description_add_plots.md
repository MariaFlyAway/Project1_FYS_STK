### Description of additional plots:

**`mse_deg_30`**:
- shows the MSE as a function of the polynomial degree for the topographical dataset up to degree 30.

**`r2_deg_30`**:
- shows the $R^2$ as a function of the polynomial degree for the topographical dataset up to degree 30.

**`bias_variance_test_train`**:
- shows the Bias, variance, training error and the test error for the topographical dataset when using bootstrap for degree 14 to 30.

**`bias_variance_percentage`**:
- shows the bias and the variance as a percentage of the total error.
