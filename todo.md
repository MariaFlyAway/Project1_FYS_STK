## Project 1

### a)

- Finish implementation of OLS
- Describe why we chose to scale/not scale data

### b)

- Implement Ridge method with Franke function
- Look at the dependence on lambda

### c)

- Implement Lasso method - done, not working entirely correctly
- iterate over different lambda values
- discuss the three models and which fits the data best

### d)

- Derive the expected value and variance - done, in its own latex-file

### e)
- bootstrap-implementation - requires that a-c is working properly


### Priorities

Finish a-c so that we can continue working on the other tasks
